  # --- TDD Exercise: Validations ---
  # TDD = Test-Driven Development
  # The idea: write the test FIRST, watch it fail,
  # then write the code to make it pass.
  #
  # Step 1: run: rails test
  #         -- this test will FAIL because Contact has
  #            no validation yet, so the save succeeds
  # Step 2: open app/models/contact.rb and add:
  #            validates :company_id, presence: true
  # Step 3: run: rails test
  #         -- the test should now PASS
